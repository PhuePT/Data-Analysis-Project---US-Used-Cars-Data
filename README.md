# Data-Analysis-Project---US-Used-Cars-Data
Data Analysis Project using Hadoop/Hive - US Used Cars Data


The aim of the CIS 5200 project was to analyze a large dataset of used cars in the US to understand the factors affecting their prices. The project involved sourcing data from Kaggle, performing data validation and preparation, and conducting descriptive and exploratory analyses using HiveQL commands. The team examined various factors such as car type, mileage, model year, accident history, and number of owners to determine their impact on used car prices. They used bar charts, line graphs, and 3D maps for data visualization. The outcome demonstrated key insights, including the influence of engine type on fuel economy, the popularity of different car models, and the effect of accidents and ownership history on car prices. Businesses can benefit from this analysis by gaining a deeper understanding of market trends and pricing dynamics, enabling them to make more informed purchasing and pricing decisions. Additionally, the insights can help businesses optimize their inventory, improve customer satisfaction by offering competitive prices, and enhance their marketing strategies to target high-demand models and regions effectively.
